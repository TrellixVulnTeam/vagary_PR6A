## Learnt:
### Features of  SASS like:
- Variable for storing reuseable codes.
- Nesting to nest selectors inside one another.
- Operator for mathematical operations.
- Partials and imports to write CSS in one file and import them into a single file.
- Mixins for writing reuseable pieces of codes. 
- Functions to create values that can be used.
- Extends to make different selectors to inherit declarations that are common to  all of them
- Control directives for writing complex codes using condition and loops
